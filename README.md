# snakes-and-ladders

Tiny web game rendition of traditional "snakes and ladders" game (aka. "chutes and ladders").

Vanilla JavaScript + [Jest tests](https://jestjs.io/).

Tried out Test Driven Development:
1. Write a test that documents a desired behaviour
2. Test fails
3. Implement a desired behaviour
4. Test passes
5. Repeat

## TODO

- Make the game playable
